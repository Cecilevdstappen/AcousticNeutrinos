# Signal reconstruction

1. Use Corsika to simulate neutrino signal, as the energy distribution as function of longitudinal bin.

2. With the cs_mean_energy_100_showers.py the average can be taken from 100 showers generated by Corsika.

3. Use the run_thermoacousticmodel_cgatius.py to plot the (mean) Corsika output as pressure as function of time. The run_thermoacousticmodel_gatius.py can also be used to add background to the signal. Output is dat/wav file. 

4. This .wav file can be plotted using the audioplot script signal vs time. 

5. The Spectrogram or Spectroplot plot the signal + background dat file as amplitude vs frequency.
